# Codechef-Notifier
Objective : 
CodeChef is a popular platform for aspiring coders to enhance their skills. However, its overloaded servers often delay the verification of submissions, wasting valuable time as users repeatedly check for results. This extension aims to save time by automatically fetching and notifying you of your results as soon as they are available, allowing you to focus on solving the next problem without constantly checking for updates.
